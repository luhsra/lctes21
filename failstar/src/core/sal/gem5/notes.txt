Working:
 - Breakpoints
 - MemAccess
 - Traps (limited to traps that are triggered in the weather-monitor experiment)
   Note: The trap number is not provided (in onTrap()), always set to 0

On Breakpoints:
 - BPRangeBreakpoints and BPSingleBreakpoints(ANY_ADDRESS) are only working with
   range breakpoints enabled.

On MemAccess:
 - MemAccess is only working on the simple cpu models (atomic simple, 
   timing simple...)
